`terka` exposes several commands and entities:

## terka entities

* tasks
* projects
* commentaries

## terka commands
* get
* list
* create
* update
* edit
* show
* done

To the typical command might look like this

```
terka projects create <options>
```

### Example commands


#### `create`

1. Create new task with a name "New task"

```
terka tasks create -n "New task"
```

2. Create new task with a name "New task" and assign it to a project "New project" with due date in 7 days

```
terka tasks create -n "New task" -p "New project" -d +7
```

3. Create a commentary for a task 123

```
terka commentaries create 123 -t "New commentary for a task"
```

#### `show`

1. Show task info for task with id 123

```
terka tasks show 123
```

2. Show project info for a project 8 (include project tasks)

```

#### `list`

1. List all projects with at least 1 active task

```

```

`list` commands can be used with the multiple terka options (listed below).

3. List all tasks from project "My project" with TODO status

```

```

`list` commands support negation, i.e. to list all tasks from project "My project that are not in BACKLOG status you can run

```
terka tasks list -p "My project" -s NOT:BACKLOG
```


#### `update`

1. Update  status for a task 123 to "REVIEW" and set due day today

```

#### `done`

`done` commands is simple - it's just updates the status of the task to done state in a convenient manner.

```
terka tasks done 123
# is equivalent to 
# terka tasks update 123 -s d
```
#### `edit`

`edit` command allows you to change either name (`--name` CLI flag) or description (`--description` CLI flag) of the task in an editor of your choice (Vim by default)

1. Edit name of the task 123
```
terka tasks edit 123 --name
```


## terka options
Options depend on a particular entity but there are some common one
* `--n|--name` - name of the entity
* `--desc|--description` - description of an entity
* `-s|--status` - status of an entity (can be one of "BACKLOG","TODO","IN_PROGRESS", "REVIEW", "DONE", "DELETED"). By default the status is BACKLOG.
	* for status we can use short names - b for BACKLOG, t for TODO, i for IN_PROGRESS, r for REVIEW, d for DONE, and x for DELETED
 * `--priority` - priority of the task (can be one of "LOW", "NORMAL", "HIGH", "URGENT"). By default the priority is NORMAL
 * `-d|--due-date` - due date (applied for tasks only). Can be specified in the following format:
 	* YYYY-MM-DD (i.e. 2023-01-01)
    * +7, -7 (in 7 days, 7 days ago)
    * today - to tasks that are due today
    * None (default value) - when we want to explicitly specify that task does not have due date.
    
 * `-p|--project` (applied to task only) - project name or project_id for a task
