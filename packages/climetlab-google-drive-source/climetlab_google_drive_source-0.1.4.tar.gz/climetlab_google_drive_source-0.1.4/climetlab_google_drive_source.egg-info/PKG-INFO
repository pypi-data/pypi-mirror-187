Description: ## climetlab-google_drive_source
        
        A source plugin for climetlab for the source google-drive.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        In this README is a description of how to use the source provided by the python package google_drive_source.
        
        ## Source description
        
        Read a publicly accessible file from google drive as if it was local (i.e. cache the file locally).
        
        ## Using climetlab to access the data
        
        See the [demo notebooks](https://github.com/ecmwf-lab/climetlab-google-drive-source/tree/main/notebooks)

        The climetlab python package allows easy access to the data with a few lines of code such as:
        ``` python
        
        !pip install climetlab climetlab-google-drive-source
        import climetlab as cml
        ds = cml.load_source("google-drive", file_id="...")
        # use ds as you would use cml.load("file", filename)
        ```
        
        Todo
        ----
        
        Add authentification support. Perhaps using the package pydrive2?
