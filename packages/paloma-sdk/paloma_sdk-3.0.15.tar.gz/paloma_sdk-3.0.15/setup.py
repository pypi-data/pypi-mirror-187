All code starting with a `>>>` is meant to run in a python interpreter, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ipython/">ipython</a>._</sub>\n\nPaloma SDK can be installed (preferably in a `virtual environment` from PyPI using `pip`) as follows:\n  \n```\n$ pip install -U paloma_sdk\n```\n\n<sub>_You might have `pip3` installed instead of `pip`; proceed according to your own setup._<sub>\n  \n❗ If you want to communicate with Paloma Classic, use paloma-sdk==2.x\n  \n## Dependencies\n\nPaloma SDK uses <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> to manage dependencies. To get set up with all the required dependencies, run:\n\n```\n$ pip install poetry\n$ poetry install\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nPaloma SDK provides extensive tests for data classes and functions. To run them, after the steps in [Dependencies](#dependencies):\n\n```\n$ make test\n```\n\n## Code Quality\n\nPaloma SDK uses <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Black</a>, <a href="https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">isort</a>, and <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Mypy</a> for checking code quality and maintaining style. To reformat, after the steps in [Dependencies](#dependencies):\n\n```\n$ make qa && make format\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n# Usage Examples\n\nPaloma SDK can help you read block data, sign and send transactions, deploy and interact with contracts, and many more.\nThe following examples are provided to help you get started. Use cases and functionalities of the Paloma SDK are not limited to the following examples and can be found in full <a href="https://paloma-money.github.io/paloma.py/index.html">here</a>.\n\nIn order to interact with the Paloma blockchain, you\'ll need a connection to a Paloma node. This can be done through setting up an LCDClient (The LCDClient is an object representing an HTTP connection to a Paloma LCD node.):\n\n```\n>>> from paloma_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient\n>>> paloma = LCDClient(chain_id="<CHECK DOCS FOR LATEST TESTNET>", url="https://testnet.palomaswap.com")\n```\n\n## Getting Blockchain Information\n\nOnce properly configured, the `LCDClient` instance will allow you to interact with the Paloma blockchain. Try getting the latest block height:\n\n```\n>>> paloma.tendermint.block_info()[\'block\'][\'header\'][\'height\']\n```\n\n`\'1687543\'`\n\n### Async Usage\n\nIf you want to make asynchronous, non-blocking LCD requests, you can use AsyncLCDClient. The interface is similar to LCDClient, except the module and wallet API functions must be awaited.\n\n<pre><code>\n>>> import asyncio \n>>> from paloma_sdk.client.lcd import AsyncLCDClient\n\n>>> async def main():\n      <strong>paloma = AsyncLCDClient("https://testnet.palomaswap.com", "<CHECK DOCS FOR LATEST TESTNET>")</strong>\n      total_supply = await paloma.bank.total()\n      print(total_supply)\n      <strong>await paloma.session.close # you must close the session</strong>\n\n>>> asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())\n</code></pre>\n\n## Building and Signing Transactions\n\nIf you wish to perform a state-changing operation on the Paloma blockchain such as sending tokens, swapping assets, withdrawing rewards, or even invoking functions on smart contracts, you must create a **transaction** and broadcast it to the network.\nPaloma SDK provides functions that help create StdTx objects.\n\n### Example Using a Wallet (_recommended_)\n\nA `Wallet` allows you to create and sign a transaction in a single step by automatically fetching the latest information from the blockchain (chain ID, account number, sequence).\n\nUse `LCDClient.wallet()` to create a Wallet from any Key instance. The Key provided should correspond to the account you intend to sign the transaction with.\n  \n<sub>**NOTE:** *If you are using MacOS and got an exception \'bad key length\' from MnemonicKey, please check your python implementation. if `python3 -c "import ssl; print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)"` returns LibreSSL 2.8.3, you need to reinstall python via pyenv or homebrew.*</sub>\n\n```\n>>> from paloma_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient\n>>> from paloma_sdk.key.mnemonic import MnemonicKey\n\n>>> mk = MnemonicKey(mnemonic=MNEMONIC)\n>>> paloma = LCDClient("https://testnet.palomaswap.com", "<CHECK DOCS FOR LATEST TESTNET>")\n>>> wallet = paloma.wallet(mk)\n```\n\nOnce you have your Wallet, you can simply create a StdTx using `Wallet.create_and_sign_tx`.\n\n```\n>>> from paloma_sdk.core.fee import Fee\n>>> from paloma_sdk.core.bank import MsgSend\n>>> from paloma_sdk.client.lcd.api.tx import CreateTxOptions\n\n>>> tx = wallet.create_and_sign_tx(CreateTxOptions(\n        msgs=[MsgSend(\n            wallet.key.acc_address,\n            RECIPIENT,\n            "1000000ugrain"    # send 1 grain\n        )],\n        memo="test transaction!",\n        fee=Fee(200000, "120000ugrain")\n    ))\n```\n\nYou should now be able to broadcast your transaction to the network.\n\n```\n>>> result = paloma.tx.broadcast(tx)\n>>> print(result)\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n# Contributing\n\nCommunity contribution, whether it\'s a new feature, correction, bug report, additional documentation, or any other feedback is always welcome.
