Analysis of the Noble eithgfold path

> but I think it’s not a tool that can be applied in every case

Okay, are you skeptical that we can talk to everyone? Or is it that you think it's possible but you just want some ease and not spend a lot of time when you don't know what the outcome will be?

> There already is violence against minorities and I think it’s getting worse. I don’t know how to make that better,

Do you see the violence towards minorities and would like to find ways to create a more safe environment for everyone?
