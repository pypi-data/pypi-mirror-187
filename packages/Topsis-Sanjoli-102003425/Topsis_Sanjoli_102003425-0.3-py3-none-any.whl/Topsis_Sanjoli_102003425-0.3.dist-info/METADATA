## How to install this package:

```
>>pip install Topsis_Sanjoli_102003425
```

### In Command Prompt

```
>> topsis data.csv "1,1,1,1" "+,+,-,+" result.csv
```

## Input file (data.csv)

The decision matrix should be constructed with each row representing a Model alternative, and each column representing a criterion like Attribute, Price or cost, Storage Space ,Camera,Looks.

| Attribute | Price or cost | Storage Space | Camera| Looks |
| -----     | -----------   | ------------- | ---- | -------|
| Mobile 1  | 250$          | 16GB          | 12MP | 5      |
| Mobile 2  | 200$          | 16GB          | 8MP  | 3      |
| Mobile 3  | 300$          | 32GB          | 16MP | 4      |
| Mobile 4  | 275$          | 32GB          | 8MP  | 4      |
| Mobile 5  | 225$          | 16GB          | 16MP | 2      |

Weights (`weights`) is not already normalised will be normalised later in the code.

Information of benefit positive(+) or negative(-) impact criteria should be provided in `impacts`.
