# IbPy - Interactive Brokers Python API

## What is IbPy?

IbPy is a third-party implementation of the API used for accessing the
Interactive Brokers on-line trading system. IbPy implements
functionality that the Python programmer can use to connect to IB,
request stock ticker data, submit orders for stocks and futures, and
more.

IbPy was created prior the release of Interactive Brokers Python API. Accordingly,
this repository is about maintenance but not further development.

# What are the requirements?

IbPy requires Python 3.x.
Previous python 2.5+ versions should work but no more tested.
