# particular

Particular is about flexible particle physics/chemistry. It provides useful interfaces for novel algorithm prototyping. 

The package has gone a long way. 

Please refer to repository from NVIDIA hackathon

And also some seminal work about interesting wave phenomena using MD simulations.
