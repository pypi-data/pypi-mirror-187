# MPOSE2021
#### A Dataset for Short-time Pose-based Human Action Recognition

This repository contains the MPOSE2021 Dataset for short-time pose-based Human Action Recognition (HAR). 
MPOSE2021 is specifically designed to perform short-time Human Action Recognition.

MPOSE2021 is developed as an evolution of the MPOSE Dataset [1-3]. It is made by human pose data detected by 
[OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) [4] and [Posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) [11] on popular datasets for HAR, i.e. Weizmann [5], i3DPost [6], IXMAS [7], KTH [8], UTKinetic-Action3D (RGB only) [9] and UTD-MHAD (RGB only) [10], alongside original video datasets, i.e. ISLD and ISLD-Additional-Sequences [1].
Since these datasets have heterogenous action labels, each dataset labels are remapped to a common and homogeneous list of actions.

This repository allows users to generate pose data for MPOSE2021 in a python-friendly format. 
Generated sequences have a number of frames between 20 and 30. 
Sequences are obtained by cutting the so-called Precursor videos (from the above-mentioned datasets), with non-overlapping sliding windows.
Frames where OpenPose/PoseNet cannot detect any subject are automatically discarded. Resulting samples contain one subject at a time, performing a fraction of a single action. Overall, MPOSE2021 contains 15429 samples, divided into 20 actions, performed by 100 subjects. 

The overview of the action composition of MPOSE2021 is provided in the following image:

Below, the steps to install the ```mpose``` library and obtain sequences are explained. Source code can be found in the [MPOSE2021 repository](https://github.com/PIC4SeRCentre/MPOSE2021_Dataset).

### Installation

Install MPOSE2021 as python package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mpose)
```
pip install mpose
```

### Getting Started

```python
# import package
import mpose

# initialize and download data
dataset = mpose.MPOSE(pose_extractor='openpose', 
                      split=1, 
                      transform='scale_and_center', 
                      data_dir='./data/')

# print data info 
dataset.get_info()

# get data samples (as numpy arrays)
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = dataset.get_dataset()
```
