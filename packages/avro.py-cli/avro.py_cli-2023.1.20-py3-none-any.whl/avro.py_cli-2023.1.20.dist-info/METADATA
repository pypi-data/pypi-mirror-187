## Overview

This Python package wraps around [avro.py](https://pypi.org/project/avro.py) in order to add support for terminal-based Bangla text parsing. It's completely optional over its parent package and completely depends on your workflow as a developer or as a conventional user.

<br>

## Installation

avro.py-cli can be installed with development environments running **Python 3.8** or later. You'll also need to have the latest version of [avro.py](https://pypi.org/project/avro.py) installed in order for the wrapper to actually work. If not installed, though, the command below will also install it as a dependency.

```bash
# installation / upgrade

$ pip install -U avro.py-cli
```

<br>

## Usage Guide

If you have done the installation correctly, the usage should be pretty easy as well:

```bash
# Get help regarding the CLI inside your terminal.
$ python3 -m avro --help 
$ avro --help 
# Minified, both of them can work depending on your environment.

# Parse a text.
$ avro parse --text "ami banglay gan gai."
$ avro parse -t "eije dekh waTar." 
# Minified --text option.

# Parse multiple texts.
$ avro parse -t "amar swopnera" -t "Dana mele ure cole" -t "obarito nIle."
```

Note that each time you parse some text, the output will be automatically copied to your clipboard for convenience.
