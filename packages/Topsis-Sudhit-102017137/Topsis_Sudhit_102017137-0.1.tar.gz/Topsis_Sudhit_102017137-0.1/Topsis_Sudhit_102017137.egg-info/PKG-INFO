## What is TOPSIS?

*Technique for **Order **Preference by **Similarity to **Ideal **S*olution
(TOPSIS) originated in the 1980s as a multi-criteria decision making method.
TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution,
and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution.
