        ## What is TOPSIS?
        
        **T**echnique for **O**rder **P**reference by **S**imilarity to **I**deal **S**olution
        (TOPSIS) originated in the 1980s as a multi-criteria decision making method.
        TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution,
        and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution.

        ## How to install this package:
        
        ```
        >> pip install Topsis_102003592
        ```
        
        ### In Command Prompt
        
        ```
        >> topsis data.csv "1,1,1,1" "+,+,-,+" result.csv
        ```
        
        ## Input file (data.csv)
        
        The decision matrix should be constructed with each row representing a Model alternative, and each column representing a criterion like Accuracy, R<sup>2</sup>, Root Mean Squared Error, Correlation, and many more.

        Weights (`weights`) is not already normalised will be normalised later in the code.
        
        Information of benefit positive(+) or negative(-) impact criteria should be provided in `impacts`.
