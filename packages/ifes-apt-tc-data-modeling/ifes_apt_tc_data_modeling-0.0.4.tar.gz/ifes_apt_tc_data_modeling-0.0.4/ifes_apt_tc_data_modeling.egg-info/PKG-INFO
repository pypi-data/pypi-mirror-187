           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# atomprobe-data-modeling

## Mission:
Foster exchange about data models and work towards specifications
of file formats from the research field of atom probe microscopy.

## Documentation of file formats and data models in atom probe status quo
In the field of atom probe microscopy detailed technical specification of the
file formats and data models in use is not available for all file formats.
A practical solution to address this limitation has been to collect instances,
i.e. example files in respective format, share and inspect them, so that
everybody can help and contribute to understand better what likely could be
the specification. Pieces of information about file formats are available
in the literature as in books by D. Larson et al. and B. Gault et al.
Individual members of the community like D. Haley have contributed much to
making the community aware of these limitations. Members like M. Kühbach
have driven the implementation and communication of the APT file format
introduced by AMETEK/Cameca with the APSuite software package.
Despite these efforts, this work is not complete.

Especially nowadays with an interest in aligning research and data stewardship
with the aims of the FAIR principles it became clear that it would be very
useful to exchange more details about data models and file formats as otherwise
it is not foreseeable how atom probe data can be made really interoperable
with electronic lab notebooks, research data management systems, and work with
tools other than of the proprietary formats of the technology partners.

In regards of this, understanding formats by examples, showed to be a slow and
error prone as the underlying source code which was used to write such files
and input, workflow, i.e. context in which the file and pieces of information
were created or numerically transformed (the provenance) might not have been
captured or/and the specific software tool(s) used might not be shared or 
publicly accessible openly.

## Benefit and Next Steps
You can easily imagine that the more people support us with this work that the
more complete our understanding and knowledge about the available file formats
in atom probe microscopy will become. This can help all of us in the long run to
build software tools which are more reliably and robustly capable of parsing
research data irrespective of which tools you use for digitalizing your
atom probe research.

The Python parsers in this repository are meant as one motivation to offer
immediate benefit to users, while the collection of examples and technical
discussions via issues serves the more long-term perspective aim to arrive
at a detailed specification or at least as robust as possible parser that
can work with all available file formats and translate between formats
and data models.

## Support us with this work
Thank you very much for supporting this activity and your time.

## Feedback, questions
Feel free to drop us a message via setting up or commenting on an issue
and feel free to use the resources in this repository.

## Where to place your examples?
There is a *examples_with_provenance* and *examples_without_provenance*
sub-directory for each file format.

When you do know with which software and measured dataset you have created a file,
you should share the file and these pieces of information (software version)
at least by naming the respective raw files. Ideally you share the examples via
offering a link to an external data repository such as Zenodo or other providers.
This not only avoids that this repository would get too much filled up with binary data.
Also it enables you to share clearly the under which license you make your examples
available.

## Provenance if possible, plain examples if in doubt
Use the *examples_with_provenance* sub-directory. With this it is at least possible
to reproduce the file creation. A practical solution is to share the screenshot to
achieve this is to upload a screenshot of the complete IVAS/APSuite version
info screen, i.e. including the APSuite version, the CernRoot version, the CamecaRoot
version, and the versions of libraries used by APSuite.

Atom probers should be aware that file formats like POS, ePOS, or APT are *not*
raw data nor are they specified. Instead, refer to RRAW, STR, RHIT and/or HITS files.
Ideally, you add unique identifiers (such as SHA256 checksums) for each raw file.
A documentation how you can do this was issued by your IFES APT TC colleagues.

When you cannot detail all these pieces of information you can still participate
and support us a lot if you share your knowledge by adding at least a link to a repository
or file share with content in the relevant atom-probe-specific file formats.
In this case, please use the *examples_without_provenance* directory.
While these examples are stripped of the context in which they were created
and used, these examples can still be very useful to run the file formats parsers
against and thus make these parsers more robust.

# Background information
Many file formats in the research field are not fully documented.
A checklist of the necessary pieces of information and documentation required
to call a data model, data schema, and/or file format fully documented in
accordance with the FAIR data and research software stewardship principles
is given below:

1. Each piece of information (bit/byte) is documented.
2. This documentation fulfills the FAIR principles, i.e.
   [Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) and
   [Barker et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)
   For binary files, tools like [kaitai struct](https://kaitai.io/) offer one strategy
   for describing the exact binary information content in the data
   item e.g. file, database entry, API post, but let alone this is insufficient.
3. To each piece of information there exists a parameterized description,
   what this piece of information means. One way to arrive at such description
   is to use a data schema or ontology.
   It is important to mention that the concepts in this schema/ontology have
   unique identifier so that each data item/piece of information is identifiable
   as an instance of an entry in a database or a knowledge graph.
   This holds independently of which research data management system
   or electronic lab notebook is used.
4. In addition, it is very useful that timestamps are associated with 
   each data item (ISO8061 with time zone information) so that it is possible
   to create a timeline of the context in which and when the e.g. file was created.

The first and second point is known as a specification with the additional
contextualization and specification offered by measures detailed in the FAIR principles.
