    VisionAI Toolkit

    VisionAI tookit provides a large number of ready-to-deploy scenarios
    built using latest computer vision frameworks. Supports many of the
    common workplace health and safety use-cases.

    Start by exploring scenarios through visionai scenario list command.
    After that, you can create a pipeline through the pipeline commands.
    Once a pipeline is configured, you can run the pipeline on the
    any number of cameras.

    Running the toolkit does assume a NVIDIA GPU powered machine for
    efficient performance. Please see the system requirements on the
    documentation.

    You can instead opt to install it through Azure Managed VM, with
    preconfigured machines & recommended hardware support. You can
    find information about this on our documentation website.

    Visit https://docs.visionify.ai for more details.
