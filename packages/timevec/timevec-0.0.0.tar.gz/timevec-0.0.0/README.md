# timevec

Functions to create time vectors

# Description

Time has a periodic nature due to the rotation of the earth and the position of the sun.
This affects human behavior in various ways.

- Seasonality ... periodicity in a year (seasonal distinction)
- Daily periodicity ... periodicity in a day (distinction between day and night)
- Day of the week ... periodicity in a week (distinction between weekdays and holidays)

When dealing with these, it is desirable to vectorize with periodicity in mind.
That is, at 23:59 on a given day, it is desirable that the value is close to 00:00 on the next day.
To achieve this, the time is represented as a combination of cos and sin.
This is called a time vector.

# Installation

```sh
pip install timevec
```

# Usage

```python
import timevec.numpy as tv
import datetime
dt = datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
vec = tv.year_vec(dt)
# array([1., 0.])
```

# Functions

- `timevec.numpy` provides functions that return numpy.ndarray.
- `timevec.builtin_math` provides functions that return tuple of float.

## year_vec

```python
year_vec(dt: datetime.datetime)
```

Create a time vector for a year.
This is a vector that has periodicity like seasonality.
(Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring)

## month_vec

```python
month_vec(dt: datetime.datetime)
```

Create a time vector for a month.
This is a vector that has periodicity in a month.
You can express periodicity such as the beginning of the month, the end of the month, and the salary day.

## week_vec

```python
week_vec(dt: datetime.datetime)
```

Create a time vector for a week.
This is a vector that has periodicity in a week.
You can express periodicity such as weekdays and holidays.

## day_vec

```python
day_vec(dt: datetime.datetime)
```

Create a time vector for a day.
This is a vector that has periodicity in a day.
You can express periodicity such as morning, noon, and night.
