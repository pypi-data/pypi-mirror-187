# Python Project Template

This project follows the Python Standards declared in [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/).
This uses a pyproject.yaml to configuration the project. In this example, [flit](https://pypi.org/project/flit/) is used to simplify the build process, and publish to pypi.

## Project Organization

- .devcontainer - This directory contains required files for creating a [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
- .github
  - workflows - Contains GitHub Actions used for building, testing and publishing.
    - publish-test.yml - Publish wheels to [https://test.pypi.org/](https://test.pypi.org/)
    - publish.yml - Publish wheels to [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/)
    - pull-request.yml - Build and Test pull requests before commiting to main.
    - template-sync.yml - Update GitHub Repo with enhancments to base template
- docs - collect documents (default format .md)
- src - place new source code here
  - python_package - sample package (this can be deleted when creating a new repository)
- tests - contains Python based test cases to validation src code
- .pre-commit-config.yaml - Contains various pre-check fixes for Python
- .templateversionrc - used to track template version usage.
- MANIFEST.in - Declares additional files to include in Python whl
- pyproject.toml - Python Project Declaration
- ws.code-workspace - Recommended configurations for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### build-system
TODO: add info on flit configuration

### project
This section defines the project metadata, which may have been previously contained in a setup.py file.

#### optional-dependencies
This are otpimal dependancey groups that can be installed via 'pip install .[tests]'.
One group is included for dependancies required for testing. A second group is included for PySpark based dependancies.

### tool
This section defines the configurations for additional tools used to format, lint, type-check, and analysis Python code.

#### bandit
Performs Security Static Analysis checks on code base.

#### black
Auto-formats code

#### coverage
Configures code coverage reports generatated during testing.

#### pyright
Performs static type checking on Python.

#### pytest
Configures various test markers used during testing.

#### pylint
Performs Linting and Static Analysis. Any modifictions made by the auto-formater (black) are always considered correct.

## Publish to PyPi from GitHub
In order to publish to PyPi, a repostirory secret must be created, "PYPI_PASSWORD". In order to publish to the Test PyPi, a second secret must be added, "TEST_PYPI_PASSWORD".
