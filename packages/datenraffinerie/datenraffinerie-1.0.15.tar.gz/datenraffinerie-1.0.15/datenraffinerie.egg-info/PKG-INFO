# Datenraffinerie

The Datenraffinerie is a tool to acquire data from the various frontend systems of HGCAL and provide a framework
for online and offline analyses to plug in to. The Datenraffinerie automates the entire DAQ process for test
systems from a user perspective. It handles configuration of the DAQ system and target and conversion of the
data from the target system into a pandas DataFrame, simplifying the life of the analysis developer.
