Impacket - No Examples
========

[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/impacket-no-examples.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/impacket-no-examples/)
[![Build and test Impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket-no-examples/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml)

FORTRA. Copyright (C) 2022 Fortra. All rights reserved.

Impacket was originally created by [SecureAuth](https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/impacket), and now maintained by Fortra's Core Security.

Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network
protocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-level
programmatic access to the packets and for some protocols (e.g.
SMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself.
Packets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from 
raw data, and the object-oriented API makes it simple to work with 
deep hierarchies of protocols.
The library in this fork does not provide examples,
which may result in detection by different anti-virus systems.

What protocols are featured?
----------------------------

 * Ethernet, Linux "Cooked" capture.
 * IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, ARP.
 * IPv4 and IPv6 Support.
 * NMB and SMB1, SMB2 and SMB3 (high-level implementations).
 * MSRPC version 5, over different transports: TCP, SMB/TCP, SMB/NetBIOS and HTTP.
 * Plain, NTLM and Kerberos authentications, using password/hashes/tickets/keys.
 * Portions/full implementation of the following MSRPC interfaces: EPM, DTYPES, LSAD, LSAT, NRPC, RRP, SAMR, SRVS, WKST, SCMR, BKRP, DHCPM, EVEN6, MGMT, SASEC, TSCH, DCOM, WMI, OXABREF, NSPI, OXNSPI.
 * Portions of TDS (MSSQL) and LDAP protocol implementations.

Setup
=====

### Quick start

In order to grab the latest stable release with `pip` run:

    python3 -m pip install impacket-no-examples


### Installing the library

In order to install the library, download and
extract the package, and execute the following command from the
directory where the Impacket's release has been unpacked:

    python3 -m pip install .

> :information_source: This will install the library into the default Python
modules path.

> We recommend using [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to
make sure system-wide installations doesn't interfere with it.


### Docker Support

Build Impacket's image:

      $ docker build -t "impacket:latest" .

Using Impacket's image:

      $ docker run -it --rm "impacket:latest"

Testing
=======

The library leverages the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) framework for organizing
and marking test cases, [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/) to automate the process of
running them across supported Python versions, and [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/)
to obtain coverage statistics.

A [comprehensive testing guide](TESTING.md) is available.
