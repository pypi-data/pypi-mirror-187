Abstract
--------

A small utility application that can register a list of ChRIS pipeline
files and all dependent plugins to a CUBE instance.

Overview
--------

This app is a straightforward CLI tool that can be used to register a
pipeline directly to a CUBE instance by using the the ``chrs`` and
``pipeline2cube`` apps.

A given pipeline (in a list) is passed to ``chrs`` to add to a CUBE. Any
plugins in the pipeline that are not currently registered to CUBE will
be returned as errors by ``chrs``.

The ``pipeline2cube`` app will then simply parse that error information
and attempt to register the missing plugin, afterwhich it will
re-attempt the ``chrs`` operation.

In some ways, this app is akin to a Linux package installer that
installs a “meta” package (a pipeline) and fetches/installs all its
dependencies (plugins) if they don’t exist (are not yet registered to a
CUBE).

Dependencies
------------

The dependencies of ``plugin2cube`` are most pertinent, i.e. ``docker``
on the host for complete plugin registration. For its part
``pipeline2cube`` relies on ``chrs`` for its internal heavy lifting.

Arguments
---------

.. code:: html

           --pipelines <comma,list,of,pipelinefiles>
           A comma separated list of pipeline files to register. These are in either
           JSON or YML format suitable for processing the ChRIS command line client
           tool `chrs` (see https://crates.io/crates/chrs).

           Each pipeline file in turn is dispatched to `chrs` for processing, and
           any outputs from `chrs` are processed to either continue, register
           missing plugins, or abort.

           [--registry <defaultContainerRegistry>] ("fnndsc")
           The default registry organization -- assumed to be valid for all
           plugins in a given pipeline.

           [--computenames <commalist,of,envs>] ("host")
           A comma separted list of compute environments within a CUBE to which
           the plugin can be registered.

           [--CUBEurl <CUBEURL>] ("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/")
           The URL of the CUBE to manage.

           [--CUBEuser <user>] ("chris")
           The name of the administration CUBE user.

           [--CUBEpasswd <password>] ("chris1234")
           The admin password.

           [--inputdir <inputdir>]
           An optional input directory specifier.

           [--outputdir <outputdir>]
           An optional output directory specifier. Some files are typically created
           and executed from the <outputdir>.

           [--man]
           If specified, show this help page and quit.

           [--verbosity <level>]
           Set the verbosity level. The app is currently chatty at level 0 and level 1
           provides even more information.

           [--debug]
           If specified, toggle internal debugging. This will break at any breakpoints
           specified with 'Env.set_trace()'

           [--debugTermsize <253,62>]
           Debugging is via telnet session. This specifies the <cols>,<rows> size of
           the terminal.

           [--debugHost <0.0.0.0>]
           Debugging is via telnet session. This specifies the host to which to connect.

           [--debugPort <7900>]
           Debugging is via telnet session. This specifies the port on which the telnet
           session is listening.

Installation
------------

Easiest vector for installation is

.. code:: bash

   pip install pipeline2cube

Examples
--------

``pipeline2cube`` accepts several CLI flags/arguments that together
specify the CUBE instance, pipelines to process, and several optional
parameters. For a full list of supported arguments, do

.. code:: shell

   pipeline2cube --man

To register a plugin, do

.. code:: shell

   pipeline2cube                                                           \
       --CUBEurl http:localhost:8000/api/v1/                               \
       --CUBEuser chrisadmin                                               \
       --CUBEpasswd something1234                                          \
       --computenames host,galena                                          \
       --registry fnndsc
       --pipeline pipeline1.yml,pipeline2.yml                              \
       --verbosity 1

Development
-----------

Instructions for developers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To debug, the simplest mechanism is to trigger the internal remote
telnet session with the ``--debug`` CLI. Then, in the code, simply add
``Env.set_trace()`` calls where appropriate. These can remain in the
codebase (i.e. you don’t need to delete/comment them out) since they are
only *live* when a ``--debug`` flag is passed.

Testing
~~~~~~~

Run unit tests using ``pytest``. Coming soon!
