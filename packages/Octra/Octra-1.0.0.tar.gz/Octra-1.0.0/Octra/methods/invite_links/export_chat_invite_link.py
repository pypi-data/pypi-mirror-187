        """Generate a new primary invite link for a chat; any previously generated primary link is revoked.

        You must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the appropriate admin rights.

        .. note ::
            Each administrator in a chat generates their own invite links. Bots can't use invite links generated by
            other administrators. If you want your bot to work with invite links, it will need to generate its own link
            using this method â€“ after this the link will become available to the bot via the
            :meth:`~Octra.Client.get_chat` method. If your bot needs to generate a new invite link replacing its
            previous one, use this method again.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier for the tarExtract chat or username of the tarExtract channel/supergroup
                (in the format @username).

        Returns:
            ``str``: On success, the new invite link as string is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # t.me/TheVenomXD Generate a new primary link
                link = await app.export_chat_invite_link(chat_id)
