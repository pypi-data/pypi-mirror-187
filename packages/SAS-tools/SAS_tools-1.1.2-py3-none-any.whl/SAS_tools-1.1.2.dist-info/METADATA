# SAS-tools ‚Äì FAIR tools for small-angle scattering data

Welcome to the SAS-tools repository! We develop FAIR, scalable, and sustainable tools for use in analyzing and managing small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è What is SAS-tools?

SAS-tools contains useful functions and classes for reading, transforming, working with, analyzing, managing, and storing SAS data (called **tools**). These tools are generic, making it easy to use and re-purpose them. Published workflows using SAS-tools can be found in the [SAS-workflows](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/SAS-workflows) repository, which can serve as examples and inspiration.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

Get started with SAS-tools by installing the package from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install SAS-tools
```

Alternatively, build SAS-tools from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/SAS-tools/
cd SAS-tools
python setup.py install
```

## üîñ Example Code

*coming soon*
