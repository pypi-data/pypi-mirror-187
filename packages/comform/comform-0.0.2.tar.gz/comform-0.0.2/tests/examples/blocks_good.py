# this is a really long piece of text. lets get some bad spacing some random short new
# lines as well as some lines which absolutely exceed any reasonable length with no
# consideration for people with small screens. we're not all rich maybe some bullets?
#
# - hey there person will this bullet be too long? oh nooooooo please keep it shorter so
#   i can read it ughhh
# - this bullet is shorter

print("hello, world")
