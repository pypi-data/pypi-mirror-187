Description: # HDMapConverter (hdmc)
        A tool for converting from Lanelet2 maps to Apollo OpenDRIVE maps
        
        ## Apollo OpenDrive
        Apollo is an architecture for autonomous driving developed by Baidu. They have made a modified version of the OpenDrive standard to suit their needs better. 
        
        This project aims to create a tool for generating maps in the Apollo version of the OpenDrive specification using data from Lanelet2 maps.
        
        ## Installation from source to system
        In the ```converter/``` folder (containing ```setup.py```):
        ```
        pip install -e ./
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        usage: python3 -m hdmc [-h] input_file output_file
        
        positional arguments:
          input_file                  Input filename
          output_file                 Output filename
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        ```
        
        ## Output
        ``base_map.txt`` is received as result. To use it in Apollo architecture, ``bin_map_generator`` and ``generate_routing_topo_graph`` scripts should be used.
