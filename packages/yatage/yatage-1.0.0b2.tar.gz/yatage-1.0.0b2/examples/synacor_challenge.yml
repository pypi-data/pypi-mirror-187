    This is a (almost) 1:1 reimplementation of the Synacor Challenge text adventure game originally created by Eric Wastl able to be ran by YATAGE. You can find the original game here: https://challenge.synacor.com/.
    You however have to implement the virtual machine needed to run it by yourself, or use my implementation: https://github.com/EpocDotFr/synacor-challenge

    As mentioned above, some parts have indeed not been implemented here because it's outside of the scope of YATAGE, or because exactly replicating the Synacor Challenge behavior would be tricky. Notes (like this one) will be displayed to give further indication when such case is encountered.

    strange book:
        look: |-
            The cover of this book subtly swirls with colors. It is titled "A Brief Introduction to Interdimensional Physics". It reads:

            Recent advances in interdimensional physics have produced fascinating
            predictions about the fundamentals of our universe! For example,
            interdimensional physics seems to predict that the universe is, at its root, a
            purely mathematical construct, and that all events are caused by the
            interactions between eight pockets of energy called "registers".
            Furthermore, it seems that while the lower registers primarily control mundane
            things like sound and light, the highest register (the so-called "eighth
            register") is used to control interdimensional events such as teleportation.

            A hypothetical such teleportation device would need to have have exactly two
            destinations. One destination would be used when the eighth register is at its
            minimum energy level - this would be the default operation assuming the user
            has no way to control the eighth register. In this situation, the teleporter
            should send the user to a preconfigured safe location as a default.

            The second destination, however, is predicted to require a very specific
            energy level in the eighth register. The teleporter must take great care to
            confirm that this energy level is exactly correct before teleporting its user!
            If it is even slightly off, the user would (probably) arrive at the correct
            location, but would briefly experience anomalies in the fabric of reality
            itself - this is, of course, not recommended. Any teleporter would need to test
            the energy level in the eighth register and abort teleportation if it is not
            exactly correct.

            This required precision implies that the confirmation mechanism would be very
            computationally expensive. While this would likely not be an issue for large-
            scale teleporters, a hypothetical hand-held teleporter would take billions of
            years to compute the result and confirm that the eighth register is correct.

            If you find yourself trapped in an alternate dimension with nothing but a
            hand-held teleporter, you will need to extract the confirmation algorithm,
            reimplement it on more powerful hardware, and optimize it. This should, at the
            very least, allow you to determine the value of the eighth register which would
            have been accepted by the teleporter's confirmation mechanism.

            Then, set the eighth register to this value, activate the teleporter, and
            bypass the confirmation mechanism. If the eighth register is set correctly, no
            anomalies should be experienced, but beware - if it is set incorrectly, the
            now-bypassed confirmation mechanism will not protect you!

            Of course, since teleportation is impossible, this is all totally ridiculous.

            Note
            ----

            After using the teleporter once, just use it a second time instead of solving this unimplemented challenge
            (see introduction note).
