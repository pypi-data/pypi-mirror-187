birdears modes and basic usage
------------------------------

birdears actually has four modes:

* melodic interval question
* harmonic interval question
* melodic dictation question
* instrumental dictation question

To see the commands avaliable just invoke the command without any arguments:

melodic
~~~~~~~

In this exercise birdears will play two notes, the tonic and the interval
melodically, ie., one after the other and you should reply which is the
correct distance between the two.

Loading from config/preset files
--------------------------------
 
Pre-made presets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
``birdears`` cointains some pre-made presets in itâ€™s ``presets/``
subdirectory.

The study for beginners is recommended by following the numeric order of
those files (000, 001, then 002 etc.)

Pre-made presets description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*write me*

Creating new preset files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can open the files cointained in birdears premade ``presets/``
folder to have an ideia on how config files are made; it is simply the
command line options written in a form ``toml`` standard.

Keybindings
-----------

On the keybindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following keyboard diagrams should give you an idea on how the
keybindings work. Please note how the keys on the line from ``z``
(*unison*) to ``,`` (comma, *octave*) represent the notes that are
*natural* to the mode, and the line above represent the chromatics.

Also, for exercises with two octaves, the **uppercased keys represent
the second octave**. For example, ``z`` is *unison*, ``,`` is the
*octave*, ``Z`` (uppercased) is the *double octave*. The same for all the other
intervals.
