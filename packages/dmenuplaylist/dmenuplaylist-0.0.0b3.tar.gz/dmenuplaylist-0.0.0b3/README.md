# dmenuplaylist
dmenuplaylist is a simple playlist manager for use with mpv.
You can add files, urls, images, whatever mpv will play to your
playlist and open that playlist in mpv. Checkout the repo
for a lua script to automatically remove any item in your playlist
once you've finished watching it.
