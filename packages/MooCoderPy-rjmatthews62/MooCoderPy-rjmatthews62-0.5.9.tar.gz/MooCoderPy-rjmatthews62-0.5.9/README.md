# MooCoderPy
Python/Tkinter version of Moocoder

MooCoder is an IDE for programming MOO Code in LambdaMOO or similar servers. It incorporates a built in
MOO/MUSH client, supports the local edit option, and allows you to load and edit object verbs in different tabs.
It supports syntax highlighting, jump to error location and a stack trace window.

This should run on Python 3.6 (or better) and uses the tkinter with no external dependencies.

This requires a desktop environment: Linux running X11 (if it has a Desktop it's running X11), Windows, MacOS should all work.

The original Delphi implementation can be found at https://github.com/rjmatthews62/MooCoder

## Installation ##
Can be installed via pip:
* pip install --upgrade moocoderpy-rjmatthews62
* python -m MooCoderPy 

### Python3 Notes ###
* Ubuntu
    *  For reasons that are not clear, the default Python3 install on Ubuntu is quite minimalist.  Tk and pip are in separate packages, so the minimum python3 install becoms:
    *  `sudo apt install python3 python3-tk python3-pip`

## Setup ##
* **Settings -> Server Config** : set server address (and port). You can also set font size. 
* **File -> Connect** - Connect to server
* **File -> Disconnect** - Disconnect from server
* **File -> Open** - Open a local file in the editor
* **File -> Save** - Save contents of current window to local file

### External Editor support: ###

If you set **@edit-option local+** on your MOO server, the **@edit** command will be redirected to MooCoderPy's internal editor.
Selecting **Edit->Send Update (or F5)** will issue the correct command to update whatever you are currently editing.
Each edited item will have its own tab, and you can use the test line as for the verbs.

**Project->New Tab (Ctrl+N)** - Loads a verb into its own tab. Press F5 to compile.

**Project->Get Verbs (Ctrl+Shift+V)** - Load all the verbs for an object into the verbs window.
    You can double click or hit Enter in the Verbs pane to edit that verb.

**Project->Get Verbs and Properties** - Load both Verbs and [Properties](#property-editing) in one operation.

**Project->Clear Project** - Close all code windows and clear verb list

**View->Toggle View Ctrl+Shift+T** - Toggle between terminal and previous edit view.

**View->Stack** - Toggle Stack Pane

**View->Help F1** - Opens this README file in browser

Basic error checking and stack trace implemented.

Syntax Highlighting implemented.

Command History is supported using the **up and down arrow keys**

Each code window has an optional single-line test command which will run on successful compile (F5)

Bracket Matching implemented

Right-Click in code window will bring up a context menu.
* **Goto Line Ctrl+G** will got to a line no in a code window.
* **Find Ctrl+F** - find text in current window
* **Find Again F3** - repeat last find
* **Replace Ctrl+H** - search and replace text
* **Refresh Ctrl+R** - Reload page from server
* **Redo Syntax** - redo syntax highlighting on page
* **Close** - Close current window.
* **Undo - Ctrl+Z** - undo last changes
* **Redo - Shift+Ctrl+Z** - redo last changes

A double-click on an error message or stack trace in either the stack or the main terminal window will go the the relevent source code.

## Property Editing ##
**Project-->Get Properties** Will load all the properties of an object into the "Properties" tab.
* Double clicking or Enter will allow editing of the property.
* Simple types (String, Int, Float, Object) will be edited in a popup window. 
* More complicated types (Map, List) are edited in an edit window. The lists and maps are split into lines for ease of reading and editing. The extra lines will be removed on update.
* Use  F5 to write the update back to the server.
* List Properties can be converted to plain text for ease of editing. This will only work with simple lists, and will save as a flattened list of strings.
* You can add a test command for each property page.

## SCRATCHPAD ##
**Edit-->Scratchpad** - Opens a scratchpad window, allowing uploading of multiline commands. F5 will send the contents of the scratchpad to the server. Use with care.

## List Navigation ##
* Property and Verb lists can be sorted by column, by clicking on the column header
* Ctrl+F and F3 work in lists for find and find again.

## Editing Shortcuts ##
Standard editing key functions should all work as expected.
* Ctrl+/ can be used for select all.
* Standard Tk key binds are here: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/text.html#M152
