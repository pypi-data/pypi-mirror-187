This package aims towards providing API interfaces for various python libraries which results in reduction of
writing boilerplate code for each project using these libraries, instead users can use this package to complete
initial setup with as less as a single function call.

For example, if a user wants to create a TCP server then instead of going through and setting up all the details,
the user can simple run a function that creates a TCP server running on socketserver library, the user only needs to
provide the hostname and port number for the server to start, like shown below

```python
    from webinteractions.server_client.tcp_socket_server import create_tcp_synchronous()
    create_tcp_synchronous(hostname="localhost", port=8000)
    Listening on localhost:8000
```

The package includes following functionalities:

* ip_functions.py module contains functions that provides you with a generator for ipv4 and ipv6 respectively.
* http_interactions.py contains two functions one for interacting with REST apis and another for getting file data
* server_client.tcp_socket_server contains functions that start a tcp server synchronous and threaded with a simple function call
* server_client.udp_socket_server does the same as tcp_socket_server just with udp protocol
* server_client.xmlrpc_wrapper.server provides a function using which a user can start a xmlrpc server and define server side functions
* server_client.xmlrpc_wrapper.client returns a server proxy using which a user can interact with xmlrpc server
