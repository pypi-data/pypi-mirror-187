# DOMESTIC CATS

Ran**DOM** For**EST** **I**n **C**lassification of **CAT**aclysmic variables and **S**upernovae (**DOMESTIC CATS**) is a model trained with data from ZTF that is availble as little as a day after the detection of an event to classify supernovae and cataclysmic variables at early times specifically designed for the Young Supernovae Experiment (YSE). 

**By entering the object ID of an event from YSE, DOMESTIC CATS will predict whether that object is more likely a supernova or cataclsymic variable.** 

# How to Use

 1. Run main.py

 2.  Upon the prompt to select single object or file, enter `object`
 3. Input the object ID of the event and run

**For a Multiple Inqueries:**

 2. Upon the prompt to select single object or file, enter `file`
 3. Load the object IDs into a .csv in the directory "Data_Input"
 4. Input the directory name and run
