=== Easily port your code between python and C++

The python bindings closely mirror the original {cpp} API, with fully typed bindings. The original code documentation is meticulously kept inside the python stubs. See for example the documentation for https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui/$$__init__$$.pyi[imgui]
, https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/implot.pyi[implot], and https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/hello_imgui.pyi[hello imgui]

Thanks to this, code completion in your favorite python IDE works like a charm, and porting code between Python and C++ becomes easy.
