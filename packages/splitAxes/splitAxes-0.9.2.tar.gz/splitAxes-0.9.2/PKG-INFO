# Simple Split X axes for matplotlib

Use gridspec to generate nxm grids of figures where the x axis on each figure
may be an split arbitrary number of times.

The axes object presented by this package is similar (though not identical) to
the axes object presented by matplotlib. This allows for a good amount of plotting
code to be directly ported.

## Installation

### From source
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/tboudreaux/splitAxes.git
 cd splitAxes
 pip instal -e .
 ```
### From PyPi
 ```bash
 pip install splitAxes
 ```

## Examples
```python
from splitAxes import split_grid
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

figRows = 2
figColums = 2

# this is a matrix of size rows x colums. Each entry in the matrix is the number of splits (NOT the number of final panels, which will be 1 + the number of splits) to generate

splitMatrix=np.array([[3,1],[0,2]])

fig, axs = split_grid(figRows, figColums, splitMatrix, figsize=(15,7))

# Example Data
X = np.linspace(-10,50, 1000)
Y = np.exp(-(X-0)**2) + np.exp(-(X-10)**2) + np.exp(-(X-20)**2)

axs[0,0].set_xlim(0,45)
axs[0,0].set_ylabel("Bob")
axs[1,0].plot(X,Y, color='green')
axs[1,1].scatter([0,3,4],[5,4,2])
axs[0,1].set_xlabel("Dave", position="manual", labelpos=0.67)

axs[1,0].fill_between([0,10], 0.3, alpha=0.5, color='blue')

plt.show()
```

This should produce an output that looks something like

![Example Output](tests/ExampleOutput.png?raw=true "Example Output")
