WARC (Web ARChive) is a file format for storing web crawls (see http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/).

This `warc` library makes it very easy to work with WARC files.:
```python
import warc
with warc.open("test.warc") as f:
    for record in f:
        print(record['WARC-Target-URI'], record['Content-Length'])
```

And WET files.:
```python
import warc
with warc.open("test.warc.wet") as f:
    for record in f:
        print(record['WARC-Target-URI'], record['Content-Length'])
```

## Documentation

The documentation of the warc library is available at http://warc.readthedocs.org/.

Apart from the installation from pip, which will not work for this warc3 version, the
interface as described there is unchanged.

### Installation of this version

If you want to use this version of WARC library, use this command for installation (for pip):
```shell
pip install warc-knot
```
