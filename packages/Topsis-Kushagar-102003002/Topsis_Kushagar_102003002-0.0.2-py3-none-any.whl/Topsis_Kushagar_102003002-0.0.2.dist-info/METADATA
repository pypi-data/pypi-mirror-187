## What is TOPSIS?

**T**echnique for **O**rder **P**reference by **S**imilarity to **I**deal **S**olution
(TOPSIS) originated in the 1980s as a multi-criteria decision making method.
TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution,
and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution.

## How to install this package:

```
>> pip install Topsis-Kushagar-102003002
```

### In Command Prompt

```
>> topsis data.csv "1,1,1,1" "+,+,-,+" result.csv
```

## Input file (data.csv)

The decision matrix should be constructed with each row representing a Model alternative, and each column representing a criterion like Accuracy, R<sup>2</sup>, Root Mean Squared Error, Correlation, and many more.

| Model | Correlation | R<sup>2</sup> | RMSE | Accuracy |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- | ---- | -------- |
| M1    | 0.79        | 0.62          | 1.25 | 60.89    |
| M2    | 0.66        | 0.44          | 2.89 | 63.07    |
| M3    | 0.56        | 0.31          | 1.57 | 62.87    |
| M4    | 0.82        | 0.67          | 2.68 | 70.19    |
| M5    | 0.75        | 0.56          | 1.3  | 80.39    |

Weights (`weights`) is not already normalised will be normalised later in the code.

Information of benefit positive(+) or negative(-) impact criteria should be provided in `impacts`.
