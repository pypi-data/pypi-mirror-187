## Scoring

Your grade is based on how many of the possible words you find:

| 2-5%        | Good Start |
| 5-8%        | Moving Up  |

| 15-25%      | Solid      |
| 25-40%      | Nice       |
| 40-50%      | Great      |
| 50-70%      | Amazing    |
| 70-100%     | Genius     |
| 100%        | Queen Bee  |

### Notes:

The word list doesn't correspond exactly to Sam's, but it was the closest I could find (margin of error seemed to be about 10%). In general, this game allows more proper nouns and fewer esoteric words, but it varies depending on the setup.
