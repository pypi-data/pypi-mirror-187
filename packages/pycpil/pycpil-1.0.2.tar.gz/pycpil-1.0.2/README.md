# Directions to use

1. Downloading the [PyCpil](https://pypi.org/project/pycpil/) pkg from PyPI.

```
$ pip install pycpil
```

2. Using python to import the PyCpil
```
>>> import pycpil as cp
```

3. Accessing help, info and the list of available ionic liquids and nanofluids in the pkg.
```
>>> cp.calculate.help()

>>> cp.calculate.info()

>>> cp.calculate.list()
```

4. Calculating isobaric heat capacity of ionic liquids or/and nanofluids (ionanofluids)

    1. Calculating heat capacity of ionic liquids. Find the name of ionic liquids from the pkg list.
    ```
    >>> cp.calculate.il('ionic liquid name', Temperature [C])
    ```



    2. Calculating heat capacity of nanofluids (ionanofluids). Find the name of ionic liquids, nano-particle and concentration of nano-particle from pkg list.
    ```
    >>> cp.calculate.inf('ionic liquid name', Concentration[wt.%], Temperature [C])
