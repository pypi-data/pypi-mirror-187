# playaudio

`pip install playaudio`

A no dependency, cross platform solution for playing a sound in MacOS/Windows/Linux. This repo was inspired by [playsound](https://github.com/TaylorSMarks/playsound), but less buggy, **way** less dependencies, better tested and simpler. Under the hood this package calls out to a subprocess to play the sound, so don't expect this package to win any performance benchmarks. If you like this library then give it star, so that others can find it.

## Install

Uses the built in system commands to play audio.

# Usage

### Python

```python
from playaudio import playaudio
playaudio("my.mp3")  # blocks until sound is played.
```

### Command line

```bash

# Develop

PR's are welcome!

To develop software git clone the repo then run `. ./activate.sh`

# Windows

This environment requires you to use `git-bash`. This library expects a sound card to be installed. If you are running on a server then you will need to install a virtual sound card. See [windows setup here](.github/workflows/push_win.yml).

# Linting

Run `./lint.sh` to find linting errors using `pylint`, `flake8` and `mypy`.
