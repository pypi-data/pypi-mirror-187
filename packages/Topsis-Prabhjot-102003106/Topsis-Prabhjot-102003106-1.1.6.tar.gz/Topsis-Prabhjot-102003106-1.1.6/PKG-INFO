## What is TOPSIS
Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) originated in the 1980s as a multi-criteria decision making method.
<br> 
TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution.

## Installation
```pip install Topsis-Prabhjot-102003106```

## Input csv format
Input file must contain three or more columns
<br>
First column is the object/variable name 
<br>
2nd to last columns contain numeric values only

## How to use it
Python File<br>
```
which includes complete code for topsis calculation
```
Command Prompt<br>
```
python <python_file> <Input Data File> <Weights> <Impacts> <Result File Name>
```
<br>

Example:<br>
```
python codefile.py inputfile.csv “1,1,1,1,2” “+,+,+,+,-” result.csv
python 102003106.py 102003106-data.csv “1,1,1,1,2” “+,+,+,+,-” 102003106-result.csv
```
<br><br>
<i>Note: The weights and impacts should be ',' seperated, input file should be in pwd.</i> 

## Functions and Return Values

```
function = topsis_calc()
return values = Creates a csv file with the topsis rank and performance score
```
