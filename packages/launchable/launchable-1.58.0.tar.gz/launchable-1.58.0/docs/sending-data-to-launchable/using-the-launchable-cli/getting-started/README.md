# Getting started with the Launchable CLI

## Creating and setting your API key

First, create an API key in the **Settings** area _(click the cog ‚öôÔ∏è icon in the sidebar)_. This authentication token lets the CLI talk to your Launchable workspace.

Then, make your API key available as the `LAUNCHABLE_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI process. How you do this depends on your CI system: _(If you're using a different CI system, check its documentation for a section about setting environment variables. Launchable works with any CI system.)_

## Installing the Launchable CLI in your CI pipeline

The Launchable CLI is a Python3 package that you can install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/launchable/). The CLI connects your build tool/test runner to Launchable.

You can install the CLI in your CI pipeline by adding the following command to the part of your CI script where you install dependencies. _(If your build and test process is split into different pipelines or machines, you'll need to do this in both places.)_

```bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade launchable~=1.0
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The CLI requires both **Python 3.5+** _and_ **Java 8+**.
{% endhint %}

## Verifying connectivity

After setting your API key and installing the CLI, you can add `launchable verify || true` to your CI script to verify that everything is set up correctly. If successful, you should receive an output such as:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# We recommend including `|| true` after launchable verify so that the exit status from the command is always 0
$ launchable verify || true

Organization: <organization name>
Workspace: <workspace name>
Platform: <platform>
Python version: <version>
Java command: <command>
launchable version: <version>
Your CLI configuration is successfully verified üéâ
```
{% endcode %}

If you get an error, see [troubleshooting.md](../../../resources/troubleshooting.md "mention").
