# Using CI integrations

If you use GitHub Actions with a supported test runner, you can start sending data to Launchable workspace very quickly. See the [github-actions.md](../../resources/ci-tool-integrations/github-actions.md "mention") page for instructions.

Otherwise, see:

* [using-test-runner-integrations.md](../using-test-runner-integrations.md "mention")
