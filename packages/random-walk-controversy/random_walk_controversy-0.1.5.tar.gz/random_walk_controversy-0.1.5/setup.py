The datasets can be found in the same repo as the original authors\' implementation.\n\n| **Dataset**    | **Seq. time (s)** | **Seq. RWC score** | **Par. time (s)** | **Par. RWC score** | **Speedup** |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------|\n| baltimore      | 618               | 0.869              | 71                | 0.872              | 8.70        |\n| beefban        | 128               | 0.873              | 19                | 0.882              | 6.73        |\n| gunsense       | 2232              | 0.851              | 221               | 0.853              | 10.10       |\n| indiana        | 229               | 0.720              | 37                | 0.727              | 6.19        |\n| indiasdaughter | 490               | 0.825              | 62                | 0.832              | 7.90        |\n\nBeside the evident speedup obtained by exploiting a multicore architecture, we can see that the sequential and parallel\nversions almost converge to the same results.\n\n## Installation\nTo install the latest version of the library just download (or clone) the current project, open a terminal and run the \nfollowing commands:\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install .\n```\nAlternatively use pip\n```\npip install random-walk-controversy\n```\n\n## Usage\n### Command line interface\n```\npython3 -m random_walk_controversy [-h] [-v] [-l] edgelist community1_nodelist community2_nodelist percent n\n```\nMore info about the parameters can be fetched by using the ```-h``` option.  \nThe option  ```-v``` can be used to increase output verbosity and print, alongside the rwc score, the statistics about\nrandom walks. If not specified, only the RWC score is printed out.  \nFinally, the ```-l``` option displays a log on the terminal everytime a simulation is completed; I have found this option \npretty usefully since it allows to estimate the time for the algorithm to complete and understand if the algorithm got \nstuck.\n\n\n### Python library\nAfter the installation, it is possible to compute the rwc score directly in the python interpreter by using the function\n```get_rwc``` inside the ```random_walk_controversy``` package.\n\n#### Example\n```python\n>>> from random_walk_controversy import get_rwc\n>>> graph = read_edgelist()\n>>> side1_nodes = read_nodelist()  # list of nodes belonging to partition 1\n>>> side2_nodes = read_nodelist()  # list of nodes belonging to partition 2\n>>> node_percentage = 0.3\n>>> number_simulations = 1000\n>>> get_rwc(graph, side1_nodes, side2_nodes, node_percentage, number_simulations)\n76.233\n```\n',
