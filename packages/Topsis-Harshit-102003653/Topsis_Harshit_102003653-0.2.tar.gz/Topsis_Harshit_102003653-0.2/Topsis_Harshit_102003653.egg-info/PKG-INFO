What is Topsis ?

Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) came in the 1980s as a multi-criteria-based decision-making method. TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest the Euclidean distance from the ideal solution and greatest distance from the negative ideal solution. 

To make this definition easier, letâ€™s suppose you want to buy a mobile phone, you go to a shop and analyze 5 mobile phones on basis of RAM, memory, display size, battery, and price. At last, youâ€™re confused after seeing so many factors and donâ€™t know how to decide which mobile phone you should purchase. TOPSIS is a way to allocate the ranks on basis of the weights and impact of the given factors. 

Weights mean how much a given factor should be taken into consideration (default weight = 1 for all factors). like you want RAM to have weighed more than other factors, so the weight of RAM can be 2, while others can have 1.
Impact means that a given factor has a positive or negative impact. Like you want Battery to be large as possible but the price of the mobile to be less as possible, so youâ€™ll assign â€˜+â€™ weight to the battery and â€˜-â€˜ weight to the price.
This method can be applied in ranking machine learning models on basis of various factors like correlation, R^2, accuracy, Root mean square error, etc. Now that we have understood what is TOPSIS, and where we can apply this. Letâ€™s see what is the procedure to implement TOPSIS on a given dataset, consisting of multiple rows (like various mobile phones) and multiple columns (like various factors).
