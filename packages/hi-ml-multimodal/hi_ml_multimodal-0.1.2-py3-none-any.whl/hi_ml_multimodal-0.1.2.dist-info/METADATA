# HI-ML Multimodal Toolbox

This toolbox provides models for working with multi-modal health data.
The code is available on [GitHub][1] and [Hugging Face ðŸ¤—][6].

## Getting started

The best way to get started is by running the [phrase grounding notebook][2].
All the dependencies will be installed upon execution, so Python 3.7 and [Jupyter][3] are the only requirements to get started.

The notebook can also be run on [Binder][4], without the need to download any code or install any libraries:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)][4]

## Installation

The latest version can be installed using `pip`:

```console
pip install "git+https://github.com/microsoft/hi-ml.git#subdirectory=hi-ml-multimodal"
```

### Development

For development, it is recommended to clone the repository and set up the environment using [`conda`][5]:

```console
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/hi-ml.git
cd hi-ml-multimodal
make env
```

This will create a `conda` environment named `multimodal` and install all the dependencies to run and test the package.

You can visit the [API documentation][9] for a deeper understanding of our tools.

## Examples

For zero-shot classification of images using text prompts, please refer to the [example
script](./test_multimodal/vlp/test_zero_shot_classification.py) that utilises a small subset of [Open-Indiana CXR
dataset][10] for pneumonia detection in Chest X-ray images. Please note that the examples and models are not intended for
deployed use cases -- commercial or otherwise -- which is currently out-of-scope.

## Hugging Face ðŸ¤—

While the [GitHub repository][1] provides examples and pipelines to use our models,
the weights and model cards are hosted on [Hugging Face ðŸ¤—][6].

## Credit

If you use our code or models in your research, please cite [the manuscript][7] (accepted to be presented at the [**European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2022**][8]).
