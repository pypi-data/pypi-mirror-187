Library for hash-based signatures.
    
The CoinZdense projects aim to provide simple post-quantum-ready 
hash-based signatures geared specifically at :

* utility blockchain projects
* distributed exchange projects
* other blockchain projects that are commonly used in a key-reuse 
  by design way.

CoinZdense explicitly does NOT aim at being a post-quantum solution 
for blockchain projects that neither rely nor would benefit from 
extensive re-usage of signing keys.
