# tooltils
A lightweight python utility library built on standard modules.\
\
This is a very early project in heavy development so there may be some bugs.

## Requirements
Both are optional if you are not going to use the `miniCompiler`.
```
pip install PyInstaller
https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/
```

## Usage
There are currently `6` different classes of functions:
- Requests (Basic http interaction)
- JSON (json file interaction)
- Time (System clock and timer actions)
- Logging (Basic terminal colours and events)
- miniCompiler ([My other github project](https://github.com/feetbots/miniCompiler))
- Interpereter (A small custom interpereter for python)

## Planned Features
- More support for Windows and Unix systems [0%]
- Faster performance utilising Cython [0%]
- POST method for http functions [25%]
