vetiver
===================================
The goal of vetiver is to provide fluent tooling to version, share, deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both recording and checking the modelâ€™s input data prototype, and predicting from a remote API endpoint.
You can use vetiver with:

- `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_
- `pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_
- `statsmodels <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`_
- `xgboost <https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/>`_

You can install the released version of vetiver from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/vetiver/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install vetiver

And the development version from `GitHub <https://github.com/rstudio/vetiver-python>`_ with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install git+https://github.com/rstudio/vetiver-python

This website documents the public API of Vetiver (for Python). See `vetiver.rstudio.com <https://vetiver.rstudio.com>`_ for
more on how to get started.
