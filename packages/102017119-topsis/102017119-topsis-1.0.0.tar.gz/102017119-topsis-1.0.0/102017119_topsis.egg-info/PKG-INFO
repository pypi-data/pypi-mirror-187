TOPSIS Package

TOPSIS stands for Technique for Oder Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. It is a method of compensatory aggregation that compares a set of alternatives by identifying weights for each criterion, normalising scores for each criterion and calculating the geometric distance between each alternative and the ideal alternative, which is the best score in each criterion. An assumption of TOPSIS is that the criteria are monotonically increasing or decreasing. In this Python package Vector Normalization has been implemented.

This package has been created based on Assignment 1 of course UCS654. Prince Sharma 102017119
