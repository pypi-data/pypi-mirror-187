## Why? 

Remember code is poetry. And we write out own story. And for this, we need a support.

Without a support, all your efforts will fail. A support takes care we do all the necessary things we would not find time during battles. We need a support. So we asked `lia` to join us. 

She protects us from malicious adversaries, and heals our organization by making our poetry better and thereby our story. 

## What?

`lia` is the best support you can hope for. She helps us to maintain our ship, fight enemies, and win customers. `lia` is all we could hope for. 

## Installation

```console
pip install lia-cli
```

## Usage

```console
lia heal package_name
```
