Description: # Topsis Value Calculator
        Selection of an appropriate Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) method for providing a solution to a given MADM problem is always challenging endeavour. The challenge is even greater for situations where for a specific MADM problem there exist multiple MADM methods with similar degree of suitability. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) helps solve MADM problems.
        
        
        This is a Python package implementing TOPSIS method for multi-criteria decision analysis.
        
        
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        **$ pip install TOPSIS-102003105** 
        
        In the commandline, you can write as -
            **$ python <package_name> <path to input_data_file_name> 
            <weights as strings> <impacts as strings> <result_file_name>**
        	
        
        E.g for input data file as data.csv, command will be like
            **$ python 102003105.py 102003105-data.csv "0,1,1,1,2,1" "+,-,-,+,-,+" 102003105-Result1.csv**
        
        
        This will give the output in 102003105-Result1.csv file
