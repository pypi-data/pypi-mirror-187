# TOPSIS Calculation

By:**Prachi Gupta**



### Title:Multiple Criteria Decision Making using TOPSIS



## What is TOPSIS:

TOPSIS is an acronym that stands for 'Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution' and is a pretty straightforward MCDA method.

It is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which was originally developed by Ching-Lai Hwang and Yoon in 1981 with further developments by Yoon in 1987, and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993.

#### How to install the TOPSIS package

```buildoutcfg

pip install Topsis-Prachi-102003018

```

#### For Calculating the TOPSIS Score

```buildoutcfg

Topsis data.csv "1,1,1,1,1" "-,+,+,+,-" result.csv

```



##### Input File(Example:data.csv):

Argument used to pass the path of the input file which conatins a dataset having different fields and to perform the topsis mathematical operations

##### Weights(Example:"1,1,1,1,1")

The weights to assigned to the different parameters in the dataset should be passed in the argument.**It must be seperated by ','.**

##### Impacts(Example:"-,+,+,+,-"):

The impacts are passed to consider which parameters have a positive impact on the decision and which one have the negative impact.**Only '+' and '-' values should be passed and should be seperated with ',' only**

##### Output File(Example:result.csv):

This argument is used to pass the path of the result file where we want the rank and score to be stored
