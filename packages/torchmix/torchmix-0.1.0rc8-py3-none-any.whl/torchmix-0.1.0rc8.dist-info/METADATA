<br />

`torchmix` is a collection of pre-made PyTorch components designed to simplify model development process, primarily for **transformers**. Our goal is to enable easy adoption of cutting-edge components with minimal code and maximum scalability.

**Note: `torchmix` is a prototype that is currently in development and has not been tested for production use. The API may change at any time.**

## Install

To use `torchmix`, you will need to have `torch` already installed on your environment.

```sh
pip install torchmix
```
