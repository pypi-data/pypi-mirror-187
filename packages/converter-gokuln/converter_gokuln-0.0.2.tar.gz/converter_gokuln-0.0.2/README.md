length converter module-lenconv.lenconv()
for converting length we should give unit1-that is orginal unit and unit -2 the unit to be converted
with this module we can convert centimeter to millimeter ,millimeter to centimeter,meter to kilometer etc
while inputting unit1 and unit2 we should enter units as:

m for metre
km for kilometer
mm for millimeter

mass converting module-massconv.massconv()
for converting mass  we should give unit1-that is orginal unit and unit -2 the unit to be converted
with this module we can convert kilogram to gram ,milligram to gram and vice-versa
while inputting unit1 and unit2 we should enter units as:
use 'g' for grams
kg for kilogram
mg for milligram

temperature converting module-tempconv.tempconv()
for converting temperature we should give unit1-that is orginal unit and unit -2 the unit to be converted
with this module we can convert faherenheit to celcius,kelvin to celcius,faherenheit to kelvin and vice-versa
