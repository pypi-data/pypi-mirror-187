        "\n",
        "Notebooks:\n",
        "\n",
        "- do not have an established method of handling sensitive data\n",
        "- are highly portable and may be run by anyone in a variety of environments, including offline\n",
        "- may need outside resources, some of which require tokens or passphrases to access\n",
        "- are often one-off works and should not require more than a couple of lines to establish an environment\n",
        "- may require different passphrases for various granular-access tokens depending on the user\n",
        "- are high-risk exposure points for sensitive data as they're commonly shared and stored in repositories\n",
        "- are often used by people who are not primarily programmers and cannot be expected to understand and trust complex security setups\n",
        "\n",
        "## Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "The feature shall:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] never store secured data in plain-text\n",
        "- [x] never display secured data without code modifications\n",
        "- [x] only require the notebook for configuration creation, modification, and use\n",
        "- [x] generate a stand-alone Python file less than 14 kB in size ([slightly-better-than-random number](https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/critical-resources-and-the-first-14kb/))\n",
        "- [x] only contain data safe for storage on public servers (*see Drawbacks below)\n",
        "- [x] be uploadable using its own functions\n",
        "- [x] not require ipython to execute (python file only)\n",
        "- [x] not require third-party files or systems (python file only)\n",
        "- [x] be easy to understand; McCabe cyclomatic complexity on functions <= 10 and overall <=5\n",
        "- [x] have easily replaced auth functions (e.g., get/set passphrase or data)\n",
        "- [x] make data access via other systems easy if the user has proper credentials\n",
        "- [x] only require a single line of code to use in notebooks\n",
        "\n",
        "## Solution\n",
        "Use `json.dumps(dictionary)` and the commonly-installed `openssl` AES 256 bit encryption with a passphrase (and salt) to create a commit-safe string containing sensitive configuration data. Generate a Python file to hold the string and necessary functions to create, upload, use, and edit it. Provide a convenience `do_setup()` function that will setup `c`onfig and download specified resources with a single line. See Examples section for more.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**\n",
        "\n",
        "This would ask for a passphrase to decrypt 'jai' and, in this case, download the private repo described in it from GitHub. If 'jai' did not exist the user would be asked if they wanted to create it. If they created a dict with FTP data epc would download from FTP instead of GitHub.\n",
        "```python\n",

        "- While the solution is portable it is also unique and may require scripting to use the generated strings in other systems. *Mitigation*: decryption only requires commonly-installed `openssl` and `gzip`, the passphrase, and a single line of code. Decrypted strings are common JSON.\n",
        "- Storing the encrypted strings on public servers is currently safe but AES 256 will, like all encryption methods, presumably be breakable in some distant future. *Mitigation*: practice security hygeine by keeping the two `openssl` lines using modern methods, and/or regularly change passwords and use tokens with expiration dates and/or only store `epc.py` or the encrypted string in a secure location.\n",
        "- The generated python file edits itself when the configuration is updated but does not keep backups. Data loss is possible. *Mitigation*: make secure backups.\n",
        "- This was written by someone who is *not* a security expert and intended for easily-managed tokens not truly sensitive data. *Mitigation*: get it approved for your use-case by your security expert.\n",
        "- With any system like this data must be decrypted to be used and that can happen on third-party servers like Colab: you cannot control what happens on third-party servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Previous Attempts\n",
        "I tried keyrings, standard *nix `pass`, GPG/PGP, SSH keys, and considered online auth service options. None of these met all constraints or were found unreliable across systems, being designed for tty or GUI and not Jupyter notebooks."
