Module for review penalizer processing logic

Review Penalizer:
Ratings are good because they give us an impression of how many people think a movie is good or bad.
However, it does matter how many people voted.
The aim is to penalize those movies where the number of ratings is low.

Find the movie with the maximum number of ratings (out of the TOP 20 only).
This is going to be the benchmark. Compare every movieâ€™s number of ratings to this
and penalize each of them based on the following rule:
- Every 100k deviation from the maximum translates to a point deduction of 0.1.

For example:
-   suppose that the movie with the highest number of ratings has 2.456.123 ratings.
    This means that for a given movie with 1.258.369 ratings and an IMDB review score of 9.4,
    the amount of the deduction is 1.1 and therefore the adjusted rating is 8.3.

@TODO: [X] - fix the type hinting for the movies parameter
       [X] - fix the logic for the numbber of ratings lookup
       (currently we are getting the higher review instead of the higher number of ratings)
