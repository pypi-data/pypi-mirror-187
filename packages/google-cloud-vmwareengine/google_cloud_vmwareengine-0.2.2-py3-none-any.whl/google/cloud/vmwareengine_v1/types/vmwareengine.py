    Attributes:

            Required. The resource name of the private cloud to be

            that follow the conventions in

            example: ``projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a``
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of private clouds to
            return in one page. The service may return fewer
            than this value. The maximum value is coerced to
            1000.
            The default value of this field is 500.
        page_token (str):
            A page token, received from a previous ``ListPrivateClouds``
            call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters provided to
            ``ListPrivateClouds`` must match the call that provided the
            page token.
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that matches resources returned in the
            response. The expression must specify the field name, a
            comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
            filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
            boolean. The comparison operator must be ``=``, ``!=``,
            ``>``, or ``<``.

            For example, if you are filtering a list of private clouds,
            you can exclude the ones named ``example-pc`` by specifying
            ``name != "example-pc"``.

            You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could
            specify ``networkConfig.managementCidr = "192.168.0.0/24"``
            to include private clouds only if they have a matching
            address in their network configuration.

            To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
            expression within parentheses. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-pc")
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:

            ::

               (name = "private-cloud-1") AND
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR
               (name = "private-cloud-2")
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned
            results are ordered by ``name`` in ascending order. You can
            also sort results in descending order based on the ``name``
            value using ``orderBy="name desc"``. Currently, only
            ordering by ``name`` is supported.

            server guarantees that a request doesn't result
            in creation of duplicate commitments for at
            least 60 minutes.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation
            with the same request ID was received, and if
            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            response. The expression must specify the field name, a
            comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
            filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
            boolean. The comparison operator must be ``=``, ``!=``,
            ``>``, or ``<``.

            For example, if you are filtering a list of network
            policies, you can exclude the ones named ``example-policy``
            by specifying ``name != "example-policy"``.

            To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
            expression within parentheses. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-policy")
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-policy-1") AND
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR
               (name = "example-policy-2")
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned
            results are ordered by ``name`` in ascending order. You can
            also sort results in descending order based on the ``name``
            value using ``orderBy="name desc"``. Currently, only
            ordering by ``name`` is supported.

            Optional. A request ID to identify requests.

            retry your request, the server will know to
            ignore the request if it has already been
            completed. The server guarantees that a request
            doesn't result in creation of duplicate
            commitments for at least 60 minutes.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation
            with the same request ID was received, and if
            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.
            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
            (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of results to return in

            The default value of this field is 500.
        page_token (str):
            A page token, received from a previous
            ``ListVmwareEngineNetworks`` call. Provide this to retrieve
            the subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters provided to
            ``ListVmwareEngineNetworks`` must match the call that
            provided the page token.
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that matches resources returned in the
            response. The expression must specify the field name, a
            comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
            filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
            boolean. The comparison operator must be ``=``, ``!=``,
            ``>``, or ``<``.

            For example, if you are filtering a list of network
            peerings, you can exclude the ones named ``example-network``
            by specifying ``name != "example-network"``.

            To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
            expression within parentheses. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-network")
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-network-1") AND
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR
               (name = "example-network-2")
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned
            results are ordered by ``name`` in ascending order. You can
            also sort results in descending order based on the ``name``
            value using ``orderBy="name desc"``. Currently, only
            ordering by ``name`` is supported.
