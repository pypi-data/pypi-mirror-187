This is a basic library to support creating and manipulating programs written in [UPLC](https://blog.hachi.one/post/an-introduction-to-plutus-core/).
It is a side product of the development of a pythonic smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain
and hence much tailored to the needs of that development.

Contributions are very welcome.
