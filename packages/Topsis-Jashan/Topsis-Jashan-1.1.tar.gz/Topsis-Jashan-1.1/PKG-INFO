# TOPSIS Package in Python
Added by: Jashan


# Concept of TOPSIS
TOPSIS is an acronym that stands for Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution and is a pretty straightforward MCDA method. As the name implies, the method is based on finding an ideal and an anti-ideal solution and comparing the distance of each one of the alternatives to those.



The rankings are displayed in the form of a table using a package 'tabulate', with the 1st rank offering us the best decision, and last rank offering the worst decision making, according to TOPSIS method.
