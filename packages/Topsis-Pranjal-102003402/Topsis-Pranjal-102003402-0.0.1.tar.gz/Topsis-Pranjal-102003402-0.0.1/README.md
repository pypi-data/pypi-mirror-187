TOPSIS is the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, and it is a multi-criteria decision analysis method. It is based on the fundamental premise that the best solution has the shortest distance from the positive-ideal solution, and the longest distance from the negative-ideal one.
