Overview
--------

Plot sets of multiqubit quantum pure states as a binary tree of Bloch spheres.

We present a representation that can display several arbitrary multi-qubit pure states, using a combination of the Bloch Sphere and the Schmidt decomposition.

Our current approaches to visualization of quantum states allow to display:

- several mono-qubit states, using the Bloch sphere
- a single multi-qubit state, sometimes with additional restrictions such as symmetry

Usage
-----

install with pip:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install qutree

And you will be able to produce this type of Bloch sphere's tree:
