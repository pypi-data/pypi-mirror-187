## Input file (data.csv)

The decision matrix should be constructed with each row representing a Model alternative, and each column representing a criterion like Accuracy, R<sup>2</sup>, Root Mean Squared Error, Correlation, and many more.

| Model |     P1      | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- | ---- | -------- | ---- |
| M1    | 0.7       | 0.5        | 7 | 37    | 11.3 |
| M2    | 0.8        | 0.6          | 7 | 46    | 13.4 |
| M3    | 0.7       | 0.5          | 7 | 48    | 14 |
| M4    | 0.9        | 0.8          | 7 | 44    | 13.2 |
| M5    | 0.9        | 0.9          | 5  | 37    | 11.1 |
| M6    | 0.9        | 0.6          | 3  | 67    | 18 |
| M7    | 0.9        | 0.5          | 7  | 39    | 11.8 |
| M8    | 0.9        | 0.9          | 5  | 46    | 13.2 |

Weights (`weights`) is not already normalised will be normalised later in the code.

Information of benefit positive(+) or negative(-) impact criteria should be provided in `impacts`.
