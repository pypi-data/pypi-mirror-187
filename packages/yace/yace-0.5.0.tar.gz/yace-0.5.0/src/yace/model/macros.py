C MACROS, one of biggest headaches when it comes to FFI interfaces, especially
for interpreted languages such as Python, since MACRO-expressions have no
symbols to "call" as these are all pre-preprocossed and gone thus, no longer
available.

Thus, **yace** only support the definition of MACRO values, such as::

    #define SOME_GLOBALLY_CONSTANT 0xACDC

Definitions such as these to translate fairly when into equivalent globally
available and constant constructs in other languages.
