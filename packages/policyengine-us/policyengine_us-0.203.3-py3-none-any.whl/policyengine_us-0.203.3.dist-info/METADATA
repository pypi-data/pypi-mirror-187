PolicyEngine US is a microsimulation model of the US state and federal tax and benefit system.
It is built and primarily supported by [PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org).
Other contributors include:
* [OpenFisca](https://openfisca.org), which developed the microsimulation framework upon which PolicyEngine is based
* [The Center for Growth and Opportunity](https://thecgo.org), which funded the development of state income tax models in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington state
* [End Poverty Make Trillions](https://www.endpovertymaketrillions.com/), which has provided unrestricted grant funding
* [Innovation Network for Communities](https://in4c.net/), which funded the development of population-level cliff analysis

To install, run `pip install policyengine-us`.
