# Snake Game

A simple snake game made with pygame with multiplayer option.

## Getting Started

1) To run the game, you should have Python 3.6.x installed. You can install it from here:  
[Python Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/)

2) After Python is installed, install pygame 1.9.4 from here:  
[Pygame 1.9.4 Download](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

    Alternatively, you can install it with pip by running
    ```sh
    pip install pygame==1.9.4
    ```

3) Clone this game's repository by running:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jprevc/SnakeGame.git
    ```
    
4) Go to repo's directory and run

    ```sh
    python snake_main.py
    ```
    
A new window should appear where you and your friend can play a game of snake. Default keys for player one are 
<kbd>&uarr;</kbd>, <kbd>&darr;</kbd>, <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> and <kbd>&larr;</kbd>. Keys for player two are 
<kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd> and <kbd>A</kbd>.

You can change the game configuration (for example number of players, number of cherries, game window size, etc.)
by modifying **config.json** file, also present in repo directory.
