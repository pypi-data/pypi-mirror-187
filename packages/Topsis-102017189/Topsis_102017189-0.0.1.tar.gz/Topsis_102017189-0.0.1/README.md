## About Topsis

The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method. 
TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest the Euclidean distance from the ideal solution and greatest distance from the negative ideal solution. 

## Installation


```bash
pip install Topsis_102017189
```

## Usage

Following query on terminal will provide you the topsis analysis for input csv file.

```
Topsis_102017189 "data.csv" "w1,w2,w3,w4,..." "i1,i2,i3,i4,..." "result.csv"

```

w1,w2,w3,w4 represent weights, and i1,i2,i3,i4 represent impacts where 1 is used for maximize and 0 for minimize. 
Size of w and i is equal to number of features.
