Provides the following capabilities:\n\n- in-text tag: delete every occurrence\n- in-text tags: Rename tag (`#tag1` -> `#tag2`)\n- frontmatter: Delete a key matching a regex pattern and all associated values\n- frontmatter: Rename a key\n- frontmatter: Delete a value matching a regex pattern from a specified key\n- frontmatter: Rename a value from a specified key\n- inline metadata: Delete a key matching a regex pattern and all associated values\n- inline metadata: Rename a key\n- inline metadata: Delete a value matching a regex pattern from a specified key\n- inline metadata: Rename a value from a specified key\n- vault: Create a backup of the Obsidian vault\n\n\n## Install\n`obsidian-metadata` requires Python v3.10 or above.\n\n\nUse [PIPX](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install this package from Github.\n\n```bash\npipx install git+https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/natelandau/obsidian-metadata\n```\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n**Important:** It is strongly recommended that you back up your vault prior to committing changes. This script makes changes directly to the markdown files in your vault. Once the changes are committed, there is no ability to recreate the original information unless you have a backup.  Follow the instructions in the script to create a backup of your vault if needed.\n\nThe author of this script is not responsible for any data loss that may occur. Use at your own risk.\n\n## Usage\nThe script provides a menu of available actions. Make as many changes as you require and review them as you go.  No changes are made to the Vault until they are explicitly committed.\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/553464.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/553464)\n\n\n### Configuration\n`obsidian-metadata` requires a configuration file at `~/.obsidian_metadata.toml`.  On first run, this file will be created.  Read the comments in this file to configure your preferences.  This configuration file contains the following information.\n\n```toml\n# Path to your obsidian vault\nvault = "/path/to/vault"\n\n# Folders within the vault to ignore when indexing metadata\nexclude_paths = [".git", ".obsidian"]\n```\n\n\n\n# Contributing\n\n## Setup: Once per project\n\nThere are two ways to contribute to this project.\n\n### 21. Containerized development (Recommended)\n\n1. Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/natelandau/obsidian-metadata`\n2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code\n3. Start the [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Run <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> → _Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container_.\n4. Run `poetry env info -p` to find the PATH to the Python interpreter if needed by VSCode.\n\n### 2. Local development\n\n1. Install Python 3.10 and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)\n2. Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/natelandau/obsidian-metadata`\n3. Install the Poetry environment with `poetry install`.\n4. Activate your Poetry environment with `poetry shell`.\n5. Install the pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install --install-hooks`.\n\n## Developing\n\n-   This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard to automate [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) with [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen).\n    -   When you\'re ready to commit changes run `cz c`\n-   Run `poe` from within the development environment to print a list of [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) tasks available to run on this project. Common commands:\n    -   `poe lint` runs all linters\n    -   `poe test` runs all tests with Pytest\n-   Run `poetry add {package}` from within the development environment to install a run time dependency and add it to `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.\n-   Run `poetry remove {package}` from within the development environment to uninstall a run time dependency and remove it from `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.\n-   Run `poetry update` from within the development environment to upgrade all dependencies to the latest versions allowed by `pyproject.toml`.\n',
