-   file: a file with '.csv' extension, which should only have numeric values for all features, beyond the second column. This file should have minimum three columns, otherwise an error would occur

-   weights: A numeric array, with weights value for each feature column

-   impacts: A character array with '+' corresponding to features with positive impact and '-' corresponding to features with negative positive impact

-   output file name: name of the output csv file having TOPSIS score and rank columns appended to the input file

| ***Output:***
| The result table will be exported to a newly created csv file with given name
