And there are several ways to get help too.

## Star **Typer** in GitHub

You can "star" Typer in GitHub (clicking the star button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/alexreg/typer-cloup" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/alexreg/typer-cloup</a>.

By adding a star, other users will be able to find it more easily and see that it has been already useful for others.

## Watch the GitHub repository for releases

You can "watch" Typer in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/alexreg/typer-cloup" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/alexreg/typer-cloup</a>.

There you can select "Releases only".

Doing it, you will receive notifications (in your email) whenever there's a new release (a new version) of **Typer** with bug fixes and new features.

## Help others with issues in GitHub

You can see <a href="https://github.com/alexreg/typer-cloup/issues" class="external-link" target="_blank">existing issues</a> and try and help others.
